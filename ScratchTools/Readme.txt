**We need your support!**

This is a project we are doing in our free time and it is really time
 consuming. If ScratchTools saves you some time and effort and you think
 this is a cool application show us your appreciation and donate via 
 paypal, helping us to cover the costs. All donators will be listed on a 
 donation page (unless they refuse to be listed) and we might consider 
 giving them greater support. What goes around comes around. We will 
 appreciate your love as well. :-)

As this is a free tool (and I mean **free** not crappy 
wanna-be-free-but-donation-is-mandatory) you are not forced to donate any money.

However, we truly hope you enjoy using ScratchTools! :-)

Thanks to Serato+Rane for an outstanding product and supprot.

Thanks for all the people who helped us so far, this is an (incomplete) list:
